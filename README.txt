Introduction
============

This part of the GroupServer usr-profile code concerned with sign up (alias
registration). It contains the pages, and templates, that are specific to
sign up.


Note about Forms
================
All forms submit to themselves, as the view handles the data, as it does
with the XForms in GroupServer 0.9. We always post, as almost all forms
have a side-effect.
